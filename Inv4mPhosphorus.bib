    abstract = {The maize (Zea mays) opaque5 (o5) locus was shown to encode the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase MGD1. Null and point mutations of o5 that affect the vitreous nature of mature endosperm engendered an allelic series of lines with stepwise reductions in gene function. C18:3/C18:2 galactolipid abundance in seedling leaves was reduced proportionally, without significant effects on total galactolipid content. This alteration in polar lipid composition disrupted the organization of thylakoid membranes into granal stacks. Total galactolipid abundance in endosperm was strongly reduced in o5- mutants, causing developmental defects and changes in starch production such that the normal simple granules were replaced with compound granules separated by amyloplast membrane. Complete loss of MGD1 function in a null mutant caused kernel lethality owing to failure in both endosperm and embryo development. The data demonstrate that low-abundance galactolipids with five double bonds serve functions in plastid membranes that are not replaced by the predominant species with six double bonds. Furthermore, the data identify a function of amyloplast membranes in the development of starch granules. Finally, the specific changes in lipid composition suggest that MGD1 can distinguish the constituency of acyl groups on its diacylglycerol substrate based upon the degree of desaturation.},

              tolerance can not only facilitate identifying relevant genes but
              also help to develop low-P tolerant cultivars. QTL meta-analysis
              was conducted after a comprehensive review of the reports on QTL
              mapping for low-P tolerance-related traits in maize. Meta-analysis
              produced 23 consensus QTL (cQTL), 17 of which located in similar
              chromosome regions to those previously reported to influence root
              traits. Meanwhile, candidate gene mining yielded 215 genes, 22 of
              which located in the cQTL regions. These 22 genes are homologous
              to 14 functionally characterized genes that were found to
              participate in plant low-P tolerance, including genes encoding
              miR399s, Pi transporters and purple acid phosphatases. Four cQTL
              loci (cQTL2-1, cQTL5-3, cQTL6-2, and cQTL10-2) may play important
              roles for low-P tolerance because each contains more original QTL
              and has better consistency across previous reports.",

It can annotate a wide range of gene or gene product identiﬁers (e.g. Entrez-Gene and Affymetrix probe identiﬁers) with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and OMIM annotation. Furthermore biomaRt enables retrieval of genomic sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct SQL queries to the BioMart databases (e.g. Ensembl). The biomaRt package provides a tight integration of large, public or locally installed BioMart databases with data analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data mining.},
